In this project, we will build a fake news classifier, to classify fake news using supervised learning with NLP.
The dataset used in this project is downloaded from the DataCamp online learning platform.

Steps involed:

1. Collect and preprocess our data
2. Determine a lable
3. Split data into training and test sets
4. Feature engineering - extract features from the text to help predict the label
5. Evaluate the trained model using the test set


The problem I am trying to solve is the detection of fake news. Fake news can have a significant negative impact on society, as it can mislead people, spread misinformation, and cause harm to individuals and organizations. Therefore, it is important to develop methods to detect and combat the spread of fake news.

In this project, I am using the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify news articles as either real or fake. I am using a dataset of labeled news articles (real or fake) to train a model, and I am using that trained model to classify new, unseen articles as real or fake.

The goal of this task is to train a model that can accurately detect fake news, and can therefore be used to help limit the spread of misinformation and protect people from being deceived by false information.
