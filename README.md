In this project, we will build a fake news classifier, to classify fake news using supervised learning with NLP.
The dataset used in this project is downloaded from the DataCamp online learning platform.

Steps involed:

1. Collect and preprocess our data
2. Determine a lable
3. Split data into training and test sets
4. Feature engineering - extract features from the text to help predict the label
5. Evaluate the trained model using the test set
